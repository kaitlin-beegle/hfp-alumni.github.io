## CV & Cover Letter Bank

This is a crowdsourced list of resumes, CVs, and cover letters that have successfully gotten someone an offer!

## How do I use the bank? 

If you're looking for inspiration- whether it be formatting materials, describing your experiences, etc.- or general curiosity, all of these materials have been submitted for your reference. 

That said, we generally discourage plagiarism or "copying" unique elements of someone's resume.  

If the author is open to sharing templates or providing feedback/guidance on your own job search, their name and contact information will be available in their materials.  If personal identifying information has been removed, it is because the author does not want their materials copied or translated into other uses. Please respect this preference. 

## How do I submit materials?

Please remember that this bank is only for those hiring materials that have successfully gotten you a job! Other than that, materials from all countries and industries are welcomed. 

To add your materials, please upload the files directly to the repository.  The name convention for files is [Company Name]_[Role you were hired for]_[Country]. 

Remember that hiring materials often contain personal information! If you do not want others to see or view this information, please be sure to censor or obscure it before posting.  If you are open to speaking about your role with interested people, or are willing to share your templates, please be sure to leave your name and contact information available. 

## Oustanding questions? 

Any additional questions can be submitted to an Alumni Group Manager (see group members for more details)
